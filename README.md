Sayo Paul | GitHub Profile
üëã I'm Sayo Paul, a dedicated software engineer with a passion for crafting sophisticated solutions and expanding the horizons of technology. You've landed on my GitHub profile, and I warmly welcome you!

About Me

I bring 5+ years of experience to the world of software development, specializing in Golang, PHP, microservices architecture, and cloud-native applications. My years of software engineering have given me the opportunity to contribute to a variety of projects and collaborate with diverse teams.

üî≠ Current Focus

Right now, I am focused on building clean and scalable Golang services that harness the power of microservices architecture.I excel in creating streamlined RESTful and gRPC-based APIs, harnessing the power of cloud platforms such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). My most recent projects exemplify my dedication to remaining at the cutting edge of contemporary software development methodologies.

üåü Highlights

REIPrintMail - I wrote a secure service that handled authentication, integrating with Supabase and Kong as an API gateway.
Worked on numerous Golang utilities/services to improve the productivity of the team.
Wrote API specs, tests and documentation for each service I worked on.
Prepared the deployment environments.
Participated in code reviews and pair programming sessions.

Sendchamp - Sendchamp is Twilio for Africa. During my time here,
I optimised various services and reduced response times of some services by as much as 60%. I employed concurrency to make the services more erfficient. I developed new features and increased the reliability of the services. I led and collaborated with other engineers to meet up with the demands of the business

Pipeops -Pipeops is a software-as-a-service platform that makes deployment, managing
and monitoring of your applications on your AWS account easy. With Pipeops,
all you need do is connect Pipeops to your AWS, GCP, Azure etc. and we
would handle it from there.
* I built the REST API controller to communicate via a RabbitMQ instance with
the
runner (Infrastructure as Code).
* I used Golang, and PostgreSQL and worked with the Kubernetes API on
AWS
EKS clusters to power functionality such as fetching pod logs and metrics.
* I worked extensively with GitHub and Gitlab's API to build functionality
such as auto-deploy triggering on push to a selected branch, organisation,
repository and branch fetching, repository content check for Dockerfile and all
git related functionality.


Vensle -Vensle is a custom e-commerce platform built using PHP. I was contracted
to rewrite the application to use modern PHP and software development
standards. I led the team of engineers and set up standard software
development procedures for the company.


DataReseller.store -Datareseller.store was a SaaS platform that made users easily own fully
automated web platforms
to resell value-added services such as data, airtime and utility bill payments.
* I used Apache proxying to proxy domains so users could have their custom
domains
map to https://datareseller.store/their_username immediately after payment
with no
manual configurations needed.
* I integrated functionality of the Flutterwave and Paystack API to power
features such as split payments, transfers, and virtual bank accounts for
resellers.
* I built a comprehensive dashboard where users could easily view analytics
from their site such as the number of orders, page views, profit made etc.
* I built site customization into the dashboard which enabled users to select
themes,
change their site appearance etc.


Kilenra -Kilenra was a classifieds website to solve my university's buying and selling
problem.
It was fun doing this because this was the first time I got to work with cloud
services Cloudinary ( for image manipulation ) and Sendgrid ( for sending
emails ) . I used PHP with an MVC implementation for the backend, and
MySQL for the database.


üöÄ Interests

I am passionate about the cloud and believe that in the future our entire lives would be based on it.
Currently learning and doing as much as I can to be a part of that future !
